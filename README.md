The 3D models used in this AR experience were created using photogrammetry, a technique that reconstructs 3D objects from multiple images. This method ensures high accuracy and realistic digital representations of the monastery’s structures and artifacts.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Photogrammetry for 3D model creation
Augmented Reality SDK (ARCore, Vuforia, etc.)
Unity / Unreal Engine (if applicable)
3D Modeling & Texturing (Blender, Maya, etc.)
